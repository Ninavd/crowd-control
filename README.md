# Pedestrian Counterflow: Investigating Lane formation through Cellular Automata dynamics

# Description
This project is part of the Complex System Simulation course at the UvA. A 2D Cellular Automata system is used to simulate a corridor containing two crowds of people, moving in opposite ways. The goal is then to investigate the emergent phenomenon of lane formation and it's dependance on several parameters.
